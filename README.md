# style-detection

## Intro
Style Detection is a deep learning program using tensor flow and google's inception image model to identify the fashion aesthetic
of somone in a photo. This was inspired by Google Cloud Platform's [april fools joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4l6TwhVAHo) from 2016.

## Usage
To get started just clone the repo, cd to its directory, and run `python image_label.py image_path.jpg` with an image of a style to be identified as an input

## The current styles supported are:
* goth
* punk
* preppy
* hiphop
* normcore
* hipster
* chic
* bohemian

more will be added soon
